These are instructions for people who know how to use Linux CLI.  If you don't know Linux, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.
These instructions are for building LineageOS 21 ONLY, not some other OS variation.  DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

You need to setup your build environment by following a guide like

https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/chagallwifi/build/

You will also need 300GB or more of disk space and 64GB DRAM.
If you have less DRAM, just make your swapfile + your physical DRAM => 64GB.
For example, if you have 16GB DRAM, then make a 48GB swapfile.
This can be on a SSD to speed things up a bit.

1. We are using LineageOS-UL for the repos.  See instructions on how to initialize
and get started at

https://github.com/LineageOS-UL/android

repo init -u https://github.com/LineageOS-UL/android.git -b lineage-21.0 --git-lfs --depth=1

2. Download the 5420-21.xml manifest file

https://github.com/retiredtab/LineageOS-build-manifests/tree/main/21/exynos5420

Put this file into the .repo/local_manifests directory

These instructions WILL CHANGE month to month.

3. setup build environment

. build/envsetup.sh

4. Git stash our changes from last month and then reapply later on after full repo sync

# stash all our changes so we get the latest repo update, then reapply patches later on
# patches made via git am are automatically removed with repo sync --force-sync

cd build/make
git stash --include-untracked
croot
cd hardware/qcom-caf/wlan
git stash --include-untracked

cd system/apex
git stash --include-untracked

# stash any changes from last time and use the nov 2024 patch file

cd .repo/manifests
git stash --include-untracked
patch -p1 < ~/Downloads/nov-2024-manifests.patch
croot

5. repo sync everything

repo sync

# Dec 1st patches not yet merged so pick them manually.
# Depending on when you sync, these patches may or may not be merged.

repopick -t U_asb_2024-12

6. Download the patches from

https://github.com/retiredtab/LineageOS-build-manifests/tree/main/21/UL-patches-2024

and put them into the ~/Downloads directory

Now we have to reapply the UL patches.
