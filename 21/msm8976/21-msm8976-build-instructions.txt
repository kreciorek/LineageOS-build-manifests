These are instructions for people who know how to use Linux CLI.  If you don't know Linux, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.
These instructions are for building LineageOS 21 ONLY, not some other OS variation.  DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

You need to setup your build environment by following a guide like

https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/chagallwifi/build/

You will also need 300GB or more of disk space and 64GB DRAM.  If you have less DRAM, just make your swapfile + your
physical DRAM => 64GB.  For example, if you have 16GB DRAM, then make a 48GB swapfile.  This can be on a SSD to speed
things up a bit.

1. We are using LineageOS-UL for the repos.  See instructions on how to initialize
and get started at

https://github.com/LineageOS-UL/android

repo init -u https://github.com/LineageOS-UL/android.git -b lineage-21.0 --git-lfs

2. Download the msm8976-21.xml manifest file

https://github.com/retiredtab/LineageOS-build-manifests/tree/main/21/msm8976

Put this file into the .repo/local_manifests directory

3. Git stash our changes from last month and then reapply later on after full repo sync

# cd into your 21 code directory and git stash all the patches and repo sync fresh after
# we will reapply these patches after a fresh repo sync
# this is needed to make monthly security patches

cd build/make
git stash --include-untracked
cd ../..
cd frameworks/base
git stash --include-untracked
cd ../..
cd hardware/qcom-caf/msm8952/display/
git stash --include-untracked
cd ../../../..
cd hardware/qcom-caf/wlan
git stash --include-untracked
cd ../../..
cd kernel/samsung/msm8976
git stash --include-untracked
cd ../../..
cd system/apex
git stash --include-untracked
cd ../..
cd .repo/manifests
git stash --include-untracked
cd ../..

4. repo sync everything
repo sync -c -j$(nproc --all) --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags

5. Download the patches from

https://github.com/retiredtab/LineageOS-build-manifests/tree/main/21/msm8976

and put them into the ~/Downloads directory

# apply patches for each monthly security build

cd build/make
patch -p1 < ~/Downloads/build_make.diff
cd ../..
cd frameworks/base
patch -p1 < ~/Downloads/frameworks_base.diff
cd ../..
cd hardware/qcom-caf/msm8952/display/
patch -p1 < ~/Downloads/hardware_qcom-caf_msm8952_display.diff
cd ../../../..
cd hardware/qcom-caf/wlan
patch -p1 < ~/Downloads/hardware_qcom-caf_wlan.diff
cd ../../..
cd kernel/samsung/msm8976
patch -p1 < ~/Downloads/kernel_samsung_msm8976.diff
cd ../../..
cd system/apex
patch -p1 < ~/Downloads/system_apex.diff
cd ../..
cd .repo/manifests
patch -p1 < ~/Downloads/repo_manifests_snippets.diff
cd ../..

6. In order for adb to work in the OS, we need to resync back to branch QPR1 where it
last worked.

repo sync --force-sync packages/modules/adb

7. code names
SM-T813 = gts210vewifi
SM-T713 = gts28vewifi

breakfast code name

example, breakfast gts210vewifi

8. brunch code name

example, brunch gts210vewifi
