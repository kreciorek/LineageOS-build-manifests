If you don't want to wait, here are the instructions on how to make Aug 5th security patches and possibly beyond.

These instructions WILL CHANGE month to month.

1. setup build environment

[code=bash]
. build/envsetup.sh
[/code]

2. The Aug 5th patches are at

https://review.lineageos.org/q/topic:"T_asb_2024-08"

As you can see, 5 repos were modified. The number of repos changed will vary month to month obviously depending on the security patches.

If we take a look at

https://github.com/orgs/LineageOS-UL/repositories

4 repos (packages/modules/Bluetooth, hardware/interfaces, frameworks/av and frameworks/base) were forked.

Since UL repos have not been updated in a few months now, we will stop using the UL repos and use the original LineageOS repos 
and apply the UL patches manually via git am command.  Thus, we need to change our .repo/manifests default.xml and snippets/losul.xml
files to reflect the above.

[code=bash]
cd .repo/manifests
# stash any changes from last time and use the new aug 2024 patch file
git stash
patch -p1 < ~/Downloads/manifests-aug-2024.patch
croot
[/code]

3. repo sync everything and manually pick the Aug 5th patches since they haven't been merged yet.

[code=bash]
repo sync --force-sync
repopick -t T_asb_2024-08
[/code]

4. Now we have to apply the UL patches to these 4 forked repos above.

[code=bash]
# Reapply UL patches below

cd packages/modules/Bluetooth
git am ~/Downloads/packages_modules_Bluetooth-july-2024.patch
croot

cd frameworks/base
git am ~/Downloads/frameworks-base-june-2024.patch
croot

cd hardware/interfaces
git am ~/Downloads/hardware_interfaces_aug-2024.patch
croot

cd frameworks/av
git am ~/Downloads/frameworks_av-aug-2024.patch 
croot
[/code]


5. # for samsung_slsi libfimg4x: Fix a -Wunreachable-code-loop-increment compilation error

[code=bash]
repopick -f 331661
[/code]

6. # Verify MPPthread patch exists.

[code=bash]
cd hardware/samsung_slsi/exynos
git diff
# If patch exists, there's no need to do the below
patch -p1 < ~/Downloads/remove-MPPThread.patch
# go back to top
croot
[/code]

7. Breakfast and Brunch as usual.
