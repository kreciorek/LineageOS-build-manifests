If you don't want to wait, here are the instructions on how to make Sept 5th security patches and possibly beyond.

These instructions WILL CHANGE month to month.

1. setup build environment

[code=bash]
. build/envsetup.sh
[/code]

2. The Sept 5th patches are at

https://review.lineageos.org/q/topic:%22T_asb_2024-09%22

As you can see, 8 repos were modified. The number of repos changed will vary month to month obviously depending on the security patches.

If we take a look at

https://github.com/orgs/LineageOS-UL/repositories

5 repos (system/sepolicy, packages/modules/Bluetooth, hardware/interfaces, frameworks/av and frameworks/base) were forked.

Since UL repos have not been updated in a few months now, we will stop using the UL repos and use the original LineageOS repos and apply the UL patches manually via git am command.  Thus, we need to change our .repo/manifests default.xml and snippets/losul.xml
files to reflect the above.

[code=bash]
cd .repo/manifests
# stash any changes from last time and use the aug 2024 patch file
# For Sept 2024, we don't need to change anything and can reuse the Aug 2024 patch file
git stash
patch -p1 < ~/Downloads/manifests-aug-2024.patch
croot
[/code]

3. repo sync everything and manually pick the Sept 5th patches since they haven't been merged yet.

[code=bash]
repo sync --force-sync
repopick -t T_asb_2024-09
#  Note the above will stop at 401157 with the following error message

# Applying change number 401157...
# ERROR: For 401157, could not determine the project path for project LineageOS/android_system_sepolicy

# That is fine, we will apply 401157 later on in step 4 with system_sepolicy-sept-2024-401157.patch

# Finish the repopick topic with last change
repopick 401163
[/code]

4. Now we have to apply the UL patches to these 5 forked repos above.

All UL patches can be found at (starting Sept 2024)

https://github.com/retiredtab/LineageOS-build-manifests/tree/main/20/UL-patches-2024

[code=bash]
# Reapply UL patches below

[/code]


5. # for samsung_slsi libfimg4x: Fix a -Wunreachable-code-loop-increment compilation error

[code=bash]
repopick -f 331661
[/code]

6. # Verify MPPthread patch exists.

[code=bash]
cd hardware/samsung_slsi/exynos
git diff
# If patch exists, there's no need to do the below
patch -p1 < ~/Downloads/remove-MPPThread.patch
# go back to top
croot
[/code]

7. Breakfast and Brunch as usual.
